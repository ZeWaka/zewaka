### Hi there!

I'm ZeWaka, one of the developers of [@Goonstation](https://github.com/goonstation), working on [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com). 

I'm very passionate about the open source community, and DevOps in general!

I also enjoy many things:
- Programming fun SS13 features in DM
- Creating art in Aseprite, Photoshop, & Illustrator
- Cooking interesting foods from around the world from scratch
